# Walkthrough - Initialisation defaults

[Back to the Challenge](../17_initialization_defaults.md)

We have a User Story relating to capacity:

```
As a system maintainer,
So that busy areas can be served more effectively,
I want to be able to specify a larger capacity when necessary.
```

It feels like we need a `capacity` attribute for our docking station.  But we can't introduce one without a unit test:

```ruby
describe DockingStation do
  # other tests omitted for brevity

  it 'has a default capacity' do
    expect(subject.capacity).to eq DockingStation::DEFAULT_CAPACITY
  end
end
```

See if you can make this test pass.  Hint: use `attr_reader` to create the `capacity` method and use `initialize` to set its initial value.  Don't forget to change the `full?` method to use our new `capacity`.

Actually, since docking station is already taking care of this, we can use the `capacity` that's already defined:

```ruby
describe DockingStation do
  describe 'dock' do
    it 'raises an error when full' do
      subject.capacity.times { subject.dock Bike.new }
      expect { subject.dock Bike.new }.to raise_error 'Docking station full'
    end
  end
end
```

We might also use a _private_ `attr_reader` to have all our references to the `@bikes` instance variable go through a single interface:

```ruby
class DockingStation
  DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 20

  attr_reader :capacity

  def initialize
    @bikes = []
    @capacity = DEFAULT_CAPACITY
  end

  def dock(bike)
    fail 'Docking station full' if full?
    bikes << bike
  end

  def release_bike
    fail 'No bikes available' if empty?
    bikes.pop
  end

  private

  attr_reader :bikes

  def full?
    bikes.count >= capacity
  end

  def empty?
    bikes.empty?
  end
end
```

We prefer to reference our instance variable within our class via getter methods in order to DRY out the '@' symbols, and so also that if we need to make some consistent initialisation or change to our instance variable, then we can do it in one place, rather than having to update a series of scattered references to instance variables throughout the class.

Going back to our User Story:

```
As a system maintainer,
So that busy areas can be served more effectively,
I want to be able to specify a larger capacity when necessary.
```

The key question is: `how will a new capacity be passed to the docking station?` Secondarily, `can docking stations change their capacity over time?`  These are questions for the client. We can email them, but in the meantime what should we assume?  

1. That docking station capacities can change over time, or
2. that they are fixed once?  

Depending on what we assume, we might choose a different route to pass the new capacity to a docking station.  If fixed once then we might well pass through an `initialize` method like so:

```
$ irb
2.1.5 :001 > require './lib/docking_station'
 => true
2.1.5 :002 > docking_station = DockingStation.new 50
  => #<DockingStation:0x007fa37eba3be0 @bikes=[], @capacity=50>
```

which would rely on an `initialize` method in our class

```ruby
class DockingStation
  def initialize(capacity)
    @capacity = capacity
  end
end
```

however if docking station capacities can vary over their lifetime then perhaps we could create a writable attribute like so:

```ruby
class DockingStation
  attr_accessor :capacity
end
```

so that we can update the docking station capacity at will:

```
$ irb
2.1.5 :001 > require './lib/docking_station'
 => true
2.1.5 :002 > docking_station = DockingStation.new
=> #<DockingStation:0x007fa37eb90338 @bikes=[], @capacity=20>
2.1.5 :003 > docking_station.capacity = 25
=> #<DockingStation:0x007fa37eb90338 @bikes=[], @capacity=25>
2.1.5 :004 > docking_station.capacity = 55
=> #<DockingStation:0x007fa37eb90338 @bikes=[], @capacity=55>
```

In the absence of information from the client, let's assume capacities are only declared at initialisation. So, using the above feature test, we need something like this at the Unit Test level:

```ruby
# in docking_station_spec.rb
describe 'initialization' do
  it 'has a variable capacity' do
    docking_station = DockingStation.new(50)
    50.times { docking_station.dock Bike.new }
    expect{ docking_station.dock Bike.new }.to raise_error 'Docking station full'
  end
end
```

We can DRY this up later. Let's make this pass:

```ruby
# in docking_station.rb
class DockingStation
  def initialize(capacity)
    @capacity = capacity
    @bikes = []
  end
end
```

OK! Now for default capacity at instantiation. No feature test needed for this one, as we already have one. So, the Unit Test is pretty much the same as the one we just wrote, but with our default capacity instead. Let's write a slightly DRYer version of the above:

```ruby
# in docking_station_spec.rb
describe 'initialization' do
  subject { DockingStation.new }
  let(:bike) { Bike.new }
  it 'defaults capacity' do
    described_class::DEFAULT_CAPACITY.times do
      subject.dock(bike)
    end
    expect{ subject.dock(bike) }.to raise_error 'Docking station full'
  end
end
```

Let's implement the failing functionality with a **default argument value**:

```ruby
# in docking_station.rb
class DockingStation
  # See how we use a default value
  # in the parameter
  def initialize(capacity=DEFAULT_CAPACITY)
    @capacity = capacity
    @bikes = []
  end
end
```

OK, we're good! All our feature tests pass, as do our Unit Tests. Let's proceed.
