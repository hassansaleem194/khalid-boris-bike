# Walkthrough - wrapping collections

[Back to the Challenge](../14_complex_attributes.md)

In comes an email from our client:

:email: Docking Stations should have a default capacity of 20. 

Rather than coding straight off, let's first **update our user stories and domain model**.

```
As a system maintainer,
So that I can plan the distribution of bikes,
I want a docking station to have a default capacity of 20 bikes.
```

OK, **now let's think code**. You might find yourself thinking:

:question: What data structure could we use to enable docking stations to contain bikes?

We could go with:

- a series of simple instance variables, each one storing a bike: `@bike0`, `@bike1`, `@bike2`;
- a simple collection object: `@bikes = []`;
- a more complicated collection object, like `@bikes = {}`;

**Simplicity first.** We should choose the _least complex data structure that supports what we need to pass our tests_.  

> It is often tempting to think: "ooh, yes, bikes could have ids and so we could use a hash and then we could grab bike by id, e.g. `{'BIKEID007': <#Bike>}`" etc., but we are _not yet working on any user stories that require bikes to have ids_.  You will make faster progress if you keep your object models and data structures **as simple as possible**.  

In this case, the array seems like a good choice for keeping track of bikes inside a docking station. No coding yet; though: Feature Tests first.

Let's adjust our existing manual feature test to support this new user story:

```
$ irb
2.1.5 :001 > require './lib/docking_station'
 => true
2.1.5 :002 > docking_station = DockingStation.new
 => #<DockingStation:0x007fe022230258 ...>
2.1.5 :003 > 20.times { docking_station.dock Bike.new }
 => #<Bike:0x007f8d7424cee0>
2.1.5 :004 > docking_station.dock Bike.new
RuntimeError: DockingStation
  .... stack trace omitted ....
```

Naturally, this won't work as expected: one step at a time.  Feature Testing is a good way to check that the system is giving you the behaviour you expect before each and every change. OK, let's start the new feature by updating our docking_station.rb unit test:

```ruby
require 'docking_station'

describe DockingStation do
  # other tests omitted for brevity

  describe '#dock' do
    it 'raises an error when full' do
      20.times { subject.dock Bike.new }
      expect { subject.dock Bike.new }.to raise_error 'Docking station full'
    end
  end
end
```

We should now have a failure from our unit test to **match the way our manual feature test fails**.  That means it's time to start changing our application code.  An array seems like a good data structure for holding the bikes: let's try one out:

```ruby
class DockingStation
  def initialize
    @bikes = []
  end

  def release_bike
    fail 'No bikes available' if @bikes.empty?
    @bikes.pop
  end

  def dock(bike)
    fail 'Docking station full' if @bikes.count >= 20
    @bikes << bike
  end
end
```

This pattern is extremely common in programming: it's called **wrapping a collection**. Take a look at the code above. There's:

- *State*: the array internal to the class. This will hold things, and we can manipulate it as the program runs.
- *Behaviour*: the methods that interact with the internal array.

In general, we should try to wrap collections whenever we use them. This is mainly because wrapping collections gives us _sensible, domain-focussed names_ for interacting with program state, and _close control over what can happen in that state_. Because we've hidden the `@bikes` array away inside a `DockingStation` object, it's harder and hackier for some other programmer to come along and interact directly with that array, or in ways we didn't expect. A great deal of program security is down to _controlling access to state_, and wrapping collections is an effective way to say "hey, this state – this array – we control how you interact with it."

You should have run `rspec` without even thinking about it.  Everything green?  Just run your manual feature test checks in IRB and then you'll be ready to commit your code to GitHub right? Naturally you've been regularly backing up your code to GitHub all along :-) Just in case here's a reminder: **You should commit on each RED - GREEN - REFACTOR cycle.**
