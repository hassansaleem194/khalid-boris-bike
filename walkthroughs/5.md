# Walkthrough - from Feature Tests to Unit Tests

[Back to the Challenge](../5_from_feature_tests_to_unit_tests.md)

We might be tempted to just make a `DockingStation` class, but if we are following the TDD approach we never write any application code in our editor without writing a test FIRST.  We want to test-drive our code using *unit tests*, so we have well-tested code.

We have identified that we need a `DockingStation` class.  But before we create one, we want a **failing unit test**.  We'll be using RSpec, a handy testing tool in Ruby (there are others).  RSpec provides a syntax that, while pure Ruby, reads very like English.

Write the following code in `spec/docking_station_spec.rb`.  **DO NOT** copy and paste this code, you must type it out yourself (not the comments). It'll help this stuff stick.

```ruby
describe DockingStation do

end
```

Your project layout should now look like this:

```sh
$ tree
.
├── README.md
└── spec
    ├── docking_station_spec.rb
    └── spec_helper.rb
```

We haven't created any expectations yet - we are just setting up the test.  Try running RSpec.  Discuss the output with your pair partner.  What do you think it means?

You should see something similar to the following:
```
$ rspec

An error occurred while loading ./spec/docking_station_spec.rb.
Failure/Error:
  describe DockingStation do

  end

NameError:
  uninitialized constant DockingStation
# ./spec/docking_station_spec.rb:1:in `<top (required)>'
No examples found.


Finished in 0.00003 seconds (files took 0.12494 seconds to load)
0 examples, 0 failures, 1 error occurred outside of examples

```

Hopefully, you were able to recognise that this does not look like an RSpec failure.  This is a Ruby error.  What is the difference?  Why are we getting a Ruby error here, rather than an RSpec failure?

**It is important to understand the difference.**  You will spend a large amount of your time as a developer *debugging* code.  The primary skill in debugging is to read and understand error messages and test failures.
