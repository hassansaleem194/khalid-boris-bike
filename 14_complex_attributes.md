# Wrapping Collections

[Back to the Challenge Map](0_challenge_map.md)

Our system now allows us to `dock` bikes up to a capacity of 1, and to `release_bike` if there is a bike available.

So far we have been assuming the capacity of a `DockingStation` instance to be 1. Your product owner receives an email from the client: they want each docking station to accept 20 bikes. A User Story for this:

```
As a system maintainer,
So that I can plan the distribution of bikes,
I want a docking station to have a default capacity of 20 bikes.
```

In this challenge, you will convert your instance variable `@bike` to reference a **collection**, allowing the docking and releasing of more than one bike. You should keep raising errors when docking a bike if the docking station is full, and when calling `release_bike` if the docking station is empty.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Wrap a collection in a class
- Set an initial attribute value using `initialize`

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Write a manual feature test for the above feature. Consider using `20.times { docking_station.dock Bike.new }`.
- [ ] Rename your attribute `@bike` to a name better reflecting that it will store more than one `Bike` instance.
- [ ] Use `rspec` to identify areas of your code that need to be updated to use this new attribute name.
- [ ] Update your existing tests to recognise this new name for the attribute.
- [ ] Use an `initialize` function to set the initial value of this attribute to a simple collection object: an empty array.
- [ ] Update your `release_bike` and `dock` methods to work with this new array (i.e. make your tests pass).
- [ ] Update your `release_bike` and `dock` guard conditions to account for the new capacity of 20 bikes.

### Hints

<details><summary>CLICK ME</summary>
  <li>Let's start with the feature test - we want to be able to dock 20 bikes without problem, then see an error when we attempt to dock the 21st.</li>
  <li>It feels as though we're going to need to make some changes to our code to accommodate this new requirement - for a start, we should change the name of our instance variable to reflect the fact that it will now be holding multiple bikes.</li>
  <li>If you run your tests now, you're likely to see several failures as a result of this name change.  Don't panic!  This is a great example of why it's so important to write tests in the first place - we have a clear picture of all of the points at which our code is now failing and the fixes we need to make.</li>
  <li>First of all, lets update the instance variable to point at a collection which can hold a number of bikes - an array seems a sensible choice</li>
  <li>The next step is to update our tests and code to deal with this change - use your currently failing tests as a guide.</li>
  <li>Now we can - finally - update the guard condition on the dock_bike method to reflect the new capacity.</li>
