Now we have a system capable of fulfilling all of our User Stories, and therefore all of our features. Our Unit Tests are isolated, and our Feature Tests are thorough.

Now, let's introduce two new objects to our domain: Vans and Garages. As you implement them you will realise how easily you can extend your domain when you follow the practices you've met this week.

Here are your User Stories:

```
As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like vans to take broken bikes from docking stations and deliver them to garages to be fixed.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like vans to collect working bikes from garages and distribute them to docking stations.
```

In this challenge, you will implement two User Stories with minimal scaffolding.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Implement a feature from scratch

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Use the Feature - Unit cycle to implement the above User Stories.

### Hints

<details><summary>CLICK ME</summary>
  <li>There's a lot of work to get through in order to complete this step!  Go right back to the start of the development process - think about what the user stories tell you about the objects you're going to need and the interactions between them.</li>
  <li>Notice that the user stories each contain a lot of information - you'll likely want to break each one up into multiple feature tests.</li>
